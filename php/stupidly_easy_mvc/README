This was a simple MVC framework that I made a few years ago, I called it Stupidly Easy MVC. Its in its original state as I wrote it. I put it in github for historical purpose, I may rewrite it and improve it. OR just laugh :)

I wrote about this on http://codesnipers.com, a site which is no longer maintained so links from there may not work.
